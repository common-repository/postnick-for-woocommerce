Postnick lets your website users auto-fill their address details in the checkout page by searching for their address nicknames, known as >>postnicks.

== Description ==

Postnick globally shrinks detailed address information (e.g. street name, zip code, building number) into custom address nicknames like >>john.home, known as >>postnicks. You can pick your own custom >>postnick and you can manage all your addresses in a single application. For more details about Postnick you can visit <a href="https://www.postnick.com" target="_blank">our website</a>.

With the Postnick for WooCommerce plugin, your website visitors will not need to fill all address fields manually in the checkout page. They can just search for their >>postnicks and all address details (country, state etc.) will be filled in automatically. It will not only decrease the time spent on the checkout page but it will also improve your website's user experience.

After you install the plugin, you need to configure it in the Postnick admin page by providing API Key, which you can obtain from your Postnick account, and Preferred Locale.
